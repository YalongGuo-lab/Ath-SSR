## Part II: Analysis of the Landscape of STR Mutations in Natural Populations

This section provides the data and scripts needed to reproduce and extend the analysis of short tandem repeat (STR) mutation patterns across natural populations.

### STR/
  per-genome STR call tables

### Matrix/
  Ath_pan.matrix: pan-STR matrix built for Arabidopsis thaliana.
  Ath_Aly.matrix: comparative matrices against outgroup genomes MN47 and NT1.
  class/ : classification of STR variation within Arabidopsis thaliana.
           classification of STR variation between Ath_pan.STR  and outgroups.

### Scripts/
readme: detailed description of classification workflows for intra- and inter-species STR variation (based on AnchorWave output).
