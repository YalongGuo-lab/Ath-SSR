Code and analysis for genome-wide analysis of STRs in Arabidopsis

Folders contain the following:

- `1-MA`:
   Estimate STR mutation rates from Arabidopsis MA lines.
  
- `2-Intra_Inter_Landscape`:
   This section provides the data and scripts needed to reproduce and extend the analysis of short tandem repeat (STR) mutation patterns across natural populations.
  
- `3-Functional_impact`:
  Scripts and files for STR-based QTL analysis.
  
- `4-Heritability`:
   Pipeline and files for STR-based heritability estimation.
